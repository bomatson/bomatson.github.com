title:  "No More Zero Days"
---

I've been stuck in a rut. A really bad one, too.

I want to build multiple, impactful businesses in my lifetime. In the past year, my efforts to achieve this have been very scattered and unorganized. That stops now!

Recently, I stumbled upon this
[Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af)
outlining a set of rules to having a "Non Zero Day". 

The basic idea: Once a day, I will achieve at least one thing that gets me one step closer to my long term goal.
In my case, a "step" could be setting up Google Ads to test the viability of a business idea, or fixing a bug for a product I'm building. 

Many folks use this method to lose weight or live a better lifestyle. My intention is to get out and make my mark.

### Day 1

Evaluating new business ideas can be exhausting, especially for solo founders.
It is very easy to get distracted in the discovery phases, since there are so many markets to persue.

To beat this, I've started using [Pivotal Tracker]() to manage business ideas.
I write stories for each aspect of business model discovery, from user testing and product validation to actual feature sets.
Each story is labeled by the business model it represents. Every time I complete or create a story, I've had a non zero day.

I'm making this publicly available, so feel free [to check in](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1545081).

Starting with this blog post, I'll be updating weekly on my progress.
