Recently, I've started to build mini-projects where I learn to use a new web development tool.

###The Mission

My first goal: Use [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) to make a simple API call.

More importantly, I wanted something to quickly get a gif that didn't require searching through Google Images. All I want is ONE gif that is EXACTLY what I'm looking for. If it happens to not fit, a page refresh should get me closer to gif glory.

That may seem like a pretty trivial need. In many ways, it absolutely is. But [Fuck It](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FILDI), this thing is just for learning anyway.

I used the wonderful [Giphly API](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI) to grab a high-quality gif from a POST request. After finally getting some pretty quality gifs, I thought, 'Great! This was fun to put together'

The result: [Gif Generator](http://gifgenerator.bomatson.com)

###Feedback

I started using it myself and had a few giggles here and there. Try searching for _Epic Fail_, it's hilarious. Go ahead, I'll wait here.

I showed it to my fiance and noticed she kept going back to get redo her search. To help, I added some copy to explain how to 'refresh to get a new gif'.

'Cool', I thought, 'This thing is kinda fun to use. My roommate might get a kick out of this'

My roommate Kevin and I spent the next hour looking for crazier topics. _disappointment_, _falling_, _breaking bad_, _bloopers_, _poop_. About a million laughs later, we honestly ran out of topics to search for.

After that, I pretty much forgot about the project until Kevin came home from work:

'I was on that gif thing for like 4 hours today! It killed my entire work day! My co-workers were even playing around with it'

I was a bit flattered, but more curious to see how it could spread in other office environments. It makes sense, as a lot of people use gifs to break the ice in a chatroom or lighten the mood

Now, I've slowly started show it to co-workers and other friends to guage their response. I don't anticipate it being a wild success or anything, but I can confirm the app has some value. Even if it is just counter-productivity

###The Takeaway

Make something that you find useful or addicting, and don't be afraid to slowly improve its addictiveness. In truth, most great products just start out as something stupid or weird.

With [Gif Generator](http://gifgenerator.bomatson.com), I didn't just learn how to make a simple API call with Sinatra. I learned how to gradually improve a product with feedback from the target audience. I can carry this on to the next one...
