This week, I took big strides improving [Nutshell](https://www.nutshll.co/), an app that turns contracts into bullet points. Unfortunately, my [Business Design Backlog](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1545081) got taken up by details that didn't really matter all that much to the end user, preventing me from running ads like [I had planned](/2016/03/idea-validation.html)

As I continue to validate this idea, I'm noticing latent entrepreneurial weaknesses in myself. I am trying so hard to make everything perfect, even though it obviously never will be. This leads to a beautifully written thing no one wants.

> Check out this app! It uses Babel to transpile my ES6 into JS! All the views are written in React! But no one cares!

This isn't an uncommon phenomena. I've seen tons of folks fall victim to this trap, so I'm happy enough being aware of the characteristic. I won't let it distract me this week.

Oh, and a sidenote, I had one zero day this week. I won't let this happen again either *
