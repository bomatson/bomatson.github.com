Big news! As of today, I'm moving on from Carbon Five to work full-time on [my own projects](https://www.payitoffapp.com/).

After closing [MyBandStock](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mybandstock) 
6 years ago, I decided to commit all my energy into being a stronger, more technical CEO. I was selling, marketing and working like crazy to build the startup, but was missing the technical backbone to make the best strategic decisions. I enjoyed coding already, so it seemed natural to pursue it with everything I had.

I remember chatting with [Mike from C5](https://www.carbonfive.com/) around that time. We discussed how I was taking this leap and getting into full time software development. He was encouraging and invited me to the Hack Nights C5 had started hosting. I went to them ... a lot of them!

Over the next couple years, I got to know more and more of the team. I was blown away with how thoughtful, creative and welcoming everyone was. The LA office was full of bright minds and incredible personalities.

Even though I already had a full time gig developing software at a startup, I knew this was the group for me. After several [T's Thai](http://tsthaiforyou.com/) lunches followed by a fancy Sugarfish lunch, Mike brought me in to interview.

Fast forward four years - I've had the chance to work alongside the best in the biz on insanely challenging technical problems. I've worked with notable clients like Groupon, Stitchfix, Fandango, as well as many awesome startups.

In NYC, I had the opportunity to help setup, recruit and open the office in Soho. I even got to host [Hack Nights of my own](https://www.meetup.com/Carbon-Five-NYC-Hack-Nights/)! Each experience added so much to my life and contributed directly to my long term goal: being a stronger technical founder.

I won't forget all the competitive Towerfall sessions, the [Otamatone](https://www.amazon.com/Otamatone-from-Maywa-Denki-White/dp/B002IGTOZQ) jams, roof beers and great times we had together. Thanks for everything, C5.
