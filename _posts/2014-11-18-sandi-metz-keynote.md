MINASWAN
===========

> Matz is nice and so we are nice

Scrolls --> Codex --> Books --> Sheet Music

Codex gradually replaced scrolls around year 0

*1450* Winepress --> Coins --> Paper -> Printing Press!

We used to need a lot of mats for every font, type, & size.

Eventually developed a way to melt lead to dynamically create type

Thomas Edison called this [hot metal typesetting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_metal_typesetting) "Eighth Wonder of the World"

> So you can never complain about CSS again

The linotype machine was replaced by computers in the 1960's

My Future
========

* Everything will change. I will die
* My body will deteriorate
* Our jobs appeared as quickly as the linotype operators, and will disappear just as quickly

> Being on the happy path of the app of your life

> Do Real Things

> It's still morning in our community. If you stand up, you can cast a large shadow

> We are here because we have the winds at our backs

> The things we do now will change the future of the world
