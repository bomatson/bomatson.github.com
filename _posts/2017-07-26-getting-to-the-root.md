Understanding someone else's problems is super hard.

We can hear what's being told to us, but still not grasp the underlying root problems.

Last week, I talked a bit about an approach to [discovering customers](/2017/07/discovering-customers.html), which involved interviewing a bunch of folks about their issues surrounding debt.
After each interview, I relistened to the recording to understand what had really been discussed.

What were the real pains? What were the common threads in each of these
discussions?

I was getting a clearer picture of how people approached debt, but it was still foggy. I needed a more detailed viewpoint since there's so much consumer pain related to debt.

# 5 Whys


Enter the [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)!

5 Whys is an exercise where you propose a problem and simply ask "why?".

Usually, you'll have more than one answer to the question. From there, you continue asking "why?" for each answer, until you've asked "why" 5 times for each problem.

Root problems end up looking quite different than the surface issues. An example chain:

> I have stomach pain

why?

> I'm hungover

why?

> I drank too much last night

why?

> I did those shots at the end of the night

why?

> I have trouble saying no to friends

Aha! Maybe a little discipline and more confidence saying no would lead to less future stomach pain? ;)

I did this same thing for my pain points. For each broad assumption, I drew a tree five levels deep.

*People have anxiety about loan payments*

*People have no visibility into the cost of debt*

I started seeing much clearer problem sets. Some examples:

- Risks are more expensive with too much debt. The more debt we take, the less we have control of our destiny.
- We don't make enough income. Many skills don't translate into market value.
- We don't have time or interest to read every loan detail. These details are purposely confusing and it's hard to determine how expensive our debt is.
- Most of us are bad at dealing with money and choose to ignore it as a way of coping.
- For loan servicers, clarity in advice means less profit, which means bad advice is given to their customers.
- Loan servicers have little reason to invest in better user experiences for their customers.

# Now What?

In my case, the 5 Whys exercise created more questions than it answered. However, I've developed cleaner statements to test in the market. That's what I needed!

Next week, I'll be discussing how I attempted to invalidate these assumptions using a series of "micro [MVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)".
