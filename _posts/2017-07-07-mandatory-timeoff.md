This is the first week of Mandatory Timeoff.  It's technically a two month
sabbatical, but with a different flavor. I plan to give myself time to reflect
and reset, but with the added bonus of "working for myself" throughout the
process.

For years, I've been working as a software consultant with the fine folks at
[Carbon Five](http://www.carbonfive.com/) on dozens of fun projects. After awhile, you start to get pretty
seasoned at jumping into the deep end of a new problem space and ramping up
quickly. Each time I do this, I wonder what it would be like to do it for
myself.

What if I dedicated the same amount of time (~3 months, 40 hours
a week, 8 hours a day) working on my own project? What would I work on?

To answer this, I started looking back at my side projects over the years. As
a full-time employee, side projects are hard because we have to sacrifice
personal time to scratch our creative itches. They are nourishing, but can be
quite draining if you're not used to [moonlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlighting).

Historically, I've been pretty bad at personal side projects. I have ideas - some good,
most bad - that I work on solo for three weeks and then lose interest on. I have
countless examples of projects that have been [partially worked on](https://github.com/bomatson/contract_reader_web) and [shelved](https://github.com/bomatson/lunchy).

Starting now until September 1, I'm dusting off one of these side projects and
documenting the results here.

When deciding on the problem space, I found
something that I could execute on quickly, had the right market timing to do
well, and could actually be grown into a revenue-generating business. It had to
be born from personal experience. On top of that, I needed to have a unique
insight into how to solve the problem in a new way.

My choice? [Payoff](https://github.com/bomatson/payoff), a solution to the myriad of looming student loan debt
problems which plague most Americans. Over the next few weeks, I'm putting on my Product Hat
and conducting surveys, user interviews, hypothesis invalidation and prototyping
before writing actual code. I've done [the startup thing before](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mybandstock), but this time
it'll be 100x better, with 100% new mistakes and wins.
