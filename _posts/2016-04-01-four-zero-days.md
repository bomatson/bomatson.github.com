title:  Four Zero Days
---

Unfortunately, I failed to keep up my progress having [no more zero days](/2016/02/no-more-zero-days.html).

I was ~26 days strong but let other obligations get in the way. Four straight zero days :/

It's not a total loss! The point of NZD is to [teach yourself forgiveness](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/wiki/the_four_pillars). Consider this my first lesson.

My takeaway from this:

> Take deliberate time away from social events.

I love the company of great friends and family. Being around others you respect and love is _crucial_ to personal growth.

At the same time, there needs to be a limit. I can't be out every night and constantly hunting down the next experience. Living in Manhattan, this will likely be a challenge :)

I'll take it one day at a time, starting now. Here's to [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g).
