# Branching Out

Alongside the interviews, I decided to try the opposite approach. I wanted to reach out to complete strangers and see if they would be willing to discuss debt.

My wonderful wife Nico helped me make some signs saying "Free Debt Advice" and "Free Student Loan Advice". I grabbed my pup Cody and went off to Washington Square Park for the day to start offering help.

**Not one person stopped the whole time**. Being near a school like NYU, you'd think that at least one person would be willing to discuss student loans.
 Maybe even get some free advice on basic credit card debt? Nope.

So I tried a similar thing via Instagram:

Same deal!

# What Happened?

At first this seemed like a bummer, but it actually gave me insight into an important and now obvious learning:

**People do not enjoy discussing debt!** (unless it's with someone they know or trust)

Debt is sensitive, personal and sometimes taboo. In our society, we treat it similarly to therapy or counseling. It's not something we'd discuss socially or with coworkers. Often, it  reminds us of a time we prefer not to re-experience.

To that end, I am **deeply** grateful to everyone who interviewed with me - I know it wasn't easy to talk about.
