Sidenote:

I'm betting that if you are running a company selling a technical product, but cannot contribute to that product yourself, you are at a disadvantage if I'm your competitor.
It's basic logic - if I can better empathsize with my team and customers, we will have a better chance of succeeding in the marketplace.
