Cult of Quality

I've been reading [Peopleware], an excellent resource for working effectively with software teams. The [authors] argue that a [Cult of Quality]()

"Cult of quality", p 168 where jelled teams always turn out something better than what the market is asking for

"Only perfect is good enough" gives the team a real chance to jell

This is at odds with many approaches to startup products, where 'perfect' can kill a company early. Maybe we need to let our ugly ducklings exist before bringing on whole teams. 

Better quality that no one wants is a death sentence. You might have the timing off, or you might just be plain wrong

Set up structure where experimentation is welcome, and perfection is too (with constraints)

Maybe the answer is: startup CEOs should be shielding their teams from the day to day craziness, giving them room to breathe and create quality software. 

Or maybe another approach is to have the experimental approach that allows for market success, and perfect THAT. You're ability to execute quickly with high quality and successful products without burn out could be a real asset

Article idea: Team formation as a network, not a mountain
