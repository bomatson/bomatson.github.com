title:  "No More Zero Days"
---

I've been stuck in a rut. A really bad one, too.

I want to build multiple, impactful business in my lifetime. Currently, my efforts to achieve this have been very scattered and unorganized. That stops now!

Recently, I stumbled upon this [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) outlining a set of rules to having
a "Non Zero Day". 

The basic idea: Once a day, I will achieve at least one thing that get me one step closer to my long term goal. A "step" could be setting up Google Ads to test the
viability of a business idea, or fixing a bug for a product I'm building. 

Many folks use this method to lose weight or live a better lifestyle. My intention is to get out and build the business I keep talking about.


### Business Designer

Evaluating new business ideas can be exhausting, especially for solo founders. Most times, we get distracted in the discovery phases, since there are so many markets to persue.

To beat this, I've started using [Pivotal Tracker](), where I write stories for each aspect of business model discovery. I'm making this publicly available, so feel free [to check in](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1545081).

Starting with this blog post, I'll be updating weekly on my progress. If you are also doing "no zero days", [ping me!](https://twitter.com/bomatson)
