title:  "Idea Validation"
---

This week, I decided to stop having zero days. If you aren't sure what that means, [check out this post](/2016/02/no-more-zero-days.html).

Result? Success! I spent ~20 minutes a day this week building out the homepage for [Nutshell](https://www.nutshll.co/). It used to look like this:

Now it looks like:

And even on mobile...

I also spent some time redefining what a "non zero day" is. My current definition:

- a day where you create 5 stories in Pivotal Tracker and prioritize them
- a day where you finish a story


In truth, I haven't actually done that much. It's just a landing page with a selling point. I need to validate so many things about whether there's really a customer segment, how much they are willing to pay, and whether they've got the money to pay it. Customer discovery is an often overlooked, but crucial aspect of initial value creation.

This week, I'm focusing my stories on idea validation. This stage involves setting up several online ads to determine which market is most interested this offering. In this case, it's finding out where having a "summarized contract" provides the most immediate value. From there, I'll have enough information to start A/B testing value propositions. Then, it's all about the best way to deliver on that value.

I am still a bit fearful that my approach is wrong. I'm sensing this has become more of a 'solution searching for a problem', but I won't let that stop me. The timing feels right for this, so I need to prove that it is!

Also, once I get a sense of who is responding, I'm going to start getting out of the door and talking to these people. Each of these will be tracked as part of this 'business design' process. Feel free to keep [tabs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1545081) :)
